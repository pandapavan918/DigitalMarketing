        <p>
          Digital marketing is the use of websites, apps, mobile devices, social
          media, search engines, and other digital means to promote and sell
          products and services. Digital marketing involves many of the same
          principles as traditional marketing and is often considered an
          additional way for companies to approach consumers and understand
          their behavior. Companies often combine traditional and digital
          marketing techniques in their strategies. But digital marketing also
          comes with its own set of challenges. Digital marketing started to
          become popular with the widespread adoption of the internet in the
          1990s.

            <h5>Trackable, measurable results</h5>
            <p>
              Measuring your online marketing with web analytics and other
              online metric tools makes it easier to establish how effective
              your campaign has been. You can obtain detailed information about
              how customers use your website or respond to your advertising.
            </p>
            <h5>Personalisation</h5>
            <p>
              If your customer database is linked to your website, then whenever
              someone visits the site, you can greet them with targeted offers.
              The more they buy from you, the more you can refine your customer
              profile and market effectively to them.
            </p>
            <h5>Openness</h5>
            <p>
              By getting involved with social media and managing it carefully,
              you can build customer loyalty and create a reputation for being
              easy to engage with.
            </p>
            <h5>Social currency</h5>
            <p>
              Digital marketing lets you create engaging campaigns using content
              marketing tactics. This content (images, videos, articles) can
              gain social currency - being passed from user to user and becoming
              viral.

              stand out against competitors and to grab attention among the many
              messages aimed at consumers online.
            </p>
            <h5>Complaints and feedback</h5>

              Negative comments or failure to respond effectively can damage
              your brand reputation
